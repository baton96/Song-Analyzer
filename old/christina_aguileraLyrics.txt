I woke up this morning with a smile on my face And nobody's gonna bring me down today Been feeling like nothing's been going my way lately But I decided right here, an' now, that my outlook's gonna change That's why I'm gonna Say goodbye to all the tears I've cried Everytime somebody hurt my pride Feelin' like they won't let me live life Take the time to look at what is mine I see every blessing so clearly And I thank God for what I got from above Chorus: I believe they can take anything from me But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace from me They can say all they wanna say about me But I'm gonna carry on (Carry on) I'mma keep on (keep on) singin' my song (La, la, la, etc.) I never wanna dwell on the pain again There's no use in relivin' how I hurt back then Rememberin' too well the hell I felt when I was runnin' out of faith Every step I'm 'bout to take moves towards a better day Cause I'm about to Say farewell to every single lie And all the fears I've held too long inside Everytime I felt I couldn't try All the negativity inside For too long, I've been strugglin', couldn't go on But now I've found I'm feelin' strong and I'm moving on Chorus: I believe they can take anything from me But they can't succeed in taking my inner peace from me They can say all they wanna say about me But I'm gonna carry on, (carry on) I'mma keep on (keep on) singin' my song Every time I tried to be what they wanted from me It never came naturally, so I ended up in misery Was unable to see all the good around me Wasted so much energy on what they thought of me Than simply just remembering to breathe I'm humanly unable to please everyone at the same time So now I find my peace of mind living one day at a time In the end I answer to one god Comes down to one love till I get to heaven above I have made the decision Never to give in Till the I day I die no matter what Im gonna carry on, I'mma keep on singin' my song (They can't take anything from me)

I remember when it all first began We were tight right from the start It wasn't long before you came on strong Trying hard to win my heart (trying to win it) I played hard to get but I couldn't help I gave up my ironing You were thoughtful Careful not to hurt the relationship What happened to those days when You used to be compassionate Caring what I thought and said So attentive gentleman Now it's hard to turn your head away from the TV set Taking me for granted lately Frankly, it's gotta quit I feel underappreciated Now girls help me out 'Cause you know what I'm talking about I say I'm feeling underappreciated For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment Back to the beginning, to the very beginning When our love was something new Back when romance was important Not just another thing to do I was feeling high on love tonight Thought I never come back down Now it seems that you and me Have lost our solid ground Half the time I realise I seem to give more than I get Funny how things seem to change After a few years commitment Used to talk for hours on end 'Bout our dreams while we lay in bed How I missed those days when you stayed awake Now you roll over and snore instead I feel underappreciated Now girls help me out 'Cause you know what I'm talking about, I say I'm feeling underappreciated For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah I miss those nice massages The long for closeness The way you talk How it turned me on The thoughtfulness and the sweetest lips I needed those days back I feel underappreciated Now girls help me out 'Cause you know what I'm talking about I say I'm feeling underappreciated For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment

Here we are, safe at last, we can breathe a sigh, it seems the storm has passed. Through it all no one knew, that all the tears in heaven would bring me back to you. No one I know, imagined we would make it, but it only matters that we both believed. You and me, we're a miracle meant to be, and nothing can change it. Mountains move, and oceans part, when they are standing in our way. You and me, we're a miracle. Angels stand watching over us, and heaven shines upon us, everyday. Every time, I felt near defeat, you were there for me on my side completely. You give me strength, you set me free. This is because of you I'm more than I can be. When I'm with you, the world is ours to reach for. Together - there's nothing we can't do. You and me, we're a miracle meant to be, and nothing can change it. Mountains move, and oceans part, when they are standing in our way. You and me, we're a miracle. Angels stand watching over us, and heaven shines upon us, everyday. The chance was so unlikely, that we would ever be two stars above the heavens. Destiny brought you to me. You and me, we're a miracle meant to be, and nothing can change it. Mountains move, and oceans part, when they are standing in our way. You and me, we're a miracle. Angels stand watching over us, and heaven shines upon us, everyday.
Woah, oh Welcome to the greatest show Greatest show on earth You've never seen before Hear the fairytale unfold What's behind the smoke and glass? Painted faces, everybody wears a mask Are you selling them your soul? Well, you'll be left out in the cold Is it all blue skies, fun and games until you fall Then you're left without anyone at all You're riding on a shooting star With a smile upon your face but soon the shine fades And you're left out all alone Wondering where did they all go? Ohh, been jaded, hated Who'll be around when the limelight's faded? Been shut down, pushed out Made to smile when I wanted to frown Always taking a bow, always working the crowd Always breaking new ground, always playing the clown Who'll be sticking it out? Who'll be staying around When the lights go down?
I wanna thank you for giving me time to breathe like a rock you waited so patiently while I got it together, while I figured it out I only looked but I never touched 'cause in my heart was a picture of us holdin' hands, making plans and it's lucky for me you understand Chorus: What a girl wants, what a girl needs Whatever makes me happy sets you free And I’m thanking you For being there for me, yeah yeah A weaker man Might have walked away But you had faith Strong enough to move over And give me space While I got it together, while I figured it out They say if you love something let it go If it comes back it’s yours That’s how you know It’s for keeps, yeah it’s for sure And you’re ready willin‘ To give me more than Chorus A girl needs something sensitive but tough Somebody there When the going gets rough Every night he’ll be giving his love To just one girl, one girl, one Somebody cool but real tender too Somebody baby just like you Can keep me hanging around with The one who always knew And I’m thanking you For being there for me Chorus (2)
